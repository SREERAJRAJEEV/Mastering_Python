## Introduction

Hangman is a word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. This version of Hangman is implemented in Python and can be played in the terminal.

## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- Displays the hangman logo and stages.
- Keeps track of correct and incorrect guesses.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for guessing letters.
- Allows players to continue or exit the game after each round.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Hangman game, follow these steps:

1. **Copy the code from:**
   ```bash
   -main.py
   -words.py
   -logo.py
   ```

2. **Ensure you have Python installed:**
   The game is implemented in Python, so make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

3. **Run the game:**

   python main.py
   ```

## How to Play

1. When you run the game, a random word will be selected from the word list.
2. The game will display a series of underscores representing the letters in the word.
3. You need to guess the word by entering one letter at a time.
4. If the guessed letter is in the word, it will replace the corresponding underscores.
5. If the guessed letter is not in the word, the hangman drawing will progress.
6. You win the game if you guess all the letters in the word before the hangman is fully drawn.
7. You lose the game if the hangman is fully drawn before you guess the word.
8. After each round, you can choose to continue or exit the game.
